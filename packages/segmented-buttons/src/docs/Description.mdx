import { Container, Row, Col } from 'storybook/blocks';
import SegmentedButtons from '../SegmentedButtons';

## Usage

For the most basic implementation, simply pass an integer from 0 to 10 in the `score` prop.

```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Row align="middle">
      <Col></Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>,
);
```

## Sizes

ReviewRating can be rendered at one of four sizes `XS | S | M | L`.

Use the `M` size on the **car review tile** for desktop and `S` on mobile.
For the **car review hero** use the `L` size on desktop and `S` on mobile.

The default size is `S`.

## IDs

ReviewRating uses IntersectionObserver to toggle the animation as it goes in and out of the viewport.
To help this work performantly, each component is given a unique id; a UUID V4 string prefixed with the string `rr-`.

However, you can pass your own id though the standard HTML id attribute. Inspect the components below to see this working
