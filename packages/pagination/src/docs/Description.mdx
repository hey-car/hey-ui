## Usage

Controlling the `Pagination` component
```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Pagination totalPages={10} currentPage={5} />
    <Pagination disabled title="Exmplae of disabled accordion">
      Amet minim mollit non deserunt ullamco est sit aliqua dolor do amet sint.
      Velit officia consequat duis enim velit mollit. Exercitation veniam
      consequat sunt nostrud amet.
    </Pagination>
    <Pagination title="What other cars are similar to the Audi Q3 Sportback?">
      In terms of trim levels, the Q3 Sportback will look sharper and get more
      equipment if you opt for one of the pricier models, but the standard Sport
      model has pretty much everything you could possibly wish for. In typical
      Audi form, the Q3 Sportback is at its most comfortable on the smallest
      wheels - the 18-inch alloys fitted to Sport models.
    </Pagination>
    <Pagination title="Whatâ€™s the best Audi Q3 Sportback model/engine to choose">
      In terms of trim levels, the Q3 Sportback will look sharper and get more
      equipment if you opt for one of the pricier models, but the standard Sport
      model has pretty much everything you could possibly wish for. In typical
      Audi form, the Q3 Sportback is at its most comfortable on the smallest
      wheels - the 18-inch alloys fitted to Sport models.
    </Pagination>
  </Container>,
);
```

## Accessibility

`Pagination` now supports keyboard navigation between accordion buttons.
Pressing the `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` keys will move focus between accordion buttons.
Pressing `space` or `enter` when focus is on the accordion panel header will toggle (expand or collapse) the accordion.
