import { Container, Row, Col } from 'storybook/blocks';
import Accordion from '../Accordion';

## Usage

Controlling the `Accordion` component, pass the `open` prop to expand or collapse the container as a first state of the tab.
For the freezing, defocus pass the tab `disabled` prop.

```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Accordion open title="Velit officia consequat duis enim velit mollit">
      You’ll struggle to find any objective reasons to buy a Q3 Sportback over
      the standard Audi Q3. But, if you want to stand out, the Sportback is
      rarer than the regular car and barely any more expensive on the used
      market. It’s cheap to run - and it’s more practical than you might expect.
      Combine that with low running costs and a strong engine line-up (including
      the 1.5 mild-hybrid petrol), and the Q3 Sportback gets easier to justify.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion disabled title="Exmplae of disabled accordion">
      Amet minim mollit non deserunt ullamco est sit aliqua dolor do amet sint.
      Velit officia consequat duis enim velit mollit. Exercitation veniam
      consequat sunt nostrud amet.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What other cars are similar to the Audi Q3 Sportback?">
      In terms of trim levels, the Q3 Sportback will look sharper and get more
      equipment if you opt for one of the pricier models, but the standard Sport
      model has pretty much everything you could possibly wish for. In typical
      Audi form, the Q3 Sportback is at its most comfortable on the smallest
      wheels - the 18-inch alloys fitted to Sport models.
    </Accordion>
