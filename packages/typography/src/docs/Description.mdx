The **Typography** component is used to display any types of text present on the **hey-ui** design system.

In the design prototypes, when clicking on text, you will find a variable name like `H1-Bold`, `SH2-ExtraBold`, `Body4-Regular`.
They describe the text variant (`H`: heading, `SH`: sub heading, `Body`: body, etc) followed by their size (`1`, `2`... `6`), and weight (`Extra bold`, `Bold`, `Regular`, etc).

In our `<Typography>` component, there are four important props that need to me included so you can successfully implement the typography required by the designers.
The props are `variant`, `size`, `weight`, and `isHighlighted`. You can find an explanation on how to use them below.

## Typography variants

Several typography elements are available in the library. They are listed below.

- Display (`variant=display`)
- Heading (`variant=heading`)
- Sub heading (`variant=subHeading`)
- Body (`variant=body`)
- Caption (`variant=caption`)
- Overline (`variant=overline`)
- Button (`variant=button`)

The variant `heading` will generate an `<h...>` HTML tag corresponding to its size (e.g. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc).

The variant caption will generate an HTML tag `<caption>`.

The variant `body` will generate an HTML tag `<p>`.

The variants `display`, `subHeading`, `overline`, and `button` will generate `<span>` HTML tags.

## Typography sizes

In the design prototypes, you will find the text variable accompanied by a number. This is the size and it ranges from `1` to `6`, where `1` is the biggest and `6` is the smallest.
Simply include the desired number (e.g. `size=1`, `size=6`, etc) and it will match the font size requested by the designers.

⚠️ **Important**: the font size will change automatically for variants **heading** and **display**, if necessary, on mobile devices. You don't need to worry about that!

⚠️ **Important**: the `size` prop is not necessary for the variant `display`, as it will always be the same size.

## Tyopography weights

In the design prototypes, you will find the text variable accompanied by a number and a weight. They are descibed below.

- Xbold (`weight=xbold`)
- Bold (`weight=bold`)
- Medium (`weight=medium`)
- Regular (`weight=regular`)
