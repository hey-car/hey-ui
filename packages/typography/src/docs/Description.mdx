The **Typography** component is used to display any types of text present on the **hey-ui** design system.

In the design prototypes, when clicking on text, you will find a variable name like `H1-Bold`, `SH2-ExtraBold`, `Body4-Regular`.
They describe the text variant (`H`: heading, `SH`: sub heading, `Body`: body, etc) followed by their size (`1`, `2`... `6`), and weight (`Extra bold`, `Bold`, `Regular`, etc).

In our `<Typography>` component, there are four important props that should be considered so you can successfully implement the typography required by the designers.

The props are `variant`, `size`, `weight`, `color`, and `isHighlighted`.

```tsx
<Typography variant="heading" size="2" weight="xbold" color="primary-500">
  Your heading here!
</Typography>

<Typography variant="caption" size="5">
  Your caption here!
</Typography>
```

You can find an explanation on how to use the props below.

## Typography variants

Several typography elements are available in the library. They are listed below.

- Display (`variant=display`)
- Heading (`variant=heading`)
- Sub heading (`variant=subHeading`)
- Body (`variant=body`)
- Caption (`variant=caption`)
- Overline (`variant=overline`)
- Button (`variant=button`)

If this prop is not set, the default is `variant=body`.

### HTML Tags

The variant `heading` will generate an HTML tag `<h{size}>` corresponding to its size (e.g. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc).

The variant `caption` will generate an HTML tag `<caption>`.

The variant `body` will generate an HTML tag `<p>`.

The variants `display`, `subHeading`, `overline`, and `button` will generate `<span>` HTML tags.

All variants consider the `font-weight` and `letter-spacing` properties according to what's required by the design system.

## Typography font sizes

In the design prototypes, you will find the text variable accompanied by a number. This is the size and it ranges from `1` to `6`, where `1` is the biggest and `6` is the smallest.
Simply include the desired number (e.g. `size=1`, `size=6`, etc) and it will match the font size requested by the designers.

⚠️ **Important**: the font size will change automatically for variants **heading** and **display**, if necessary, on mobile devices. You don't need to worry about that!

⚠️ **Important**: the `size` prop is not necessary for the variant `display`, as it will always be the same size.

If this prop is not set, the default is `size=2`.

## Typography font weights

In the design prototypes, you will find the text variable accompanied by a number and a weight. They are descibed below.

- Xbold (`weight=xbold`)
- Bold (`weight=bold`)
- Medium (`weight=medium`)
- Regular (`weight=regular`)

If this prop is not set, the default is `weight=regular`.

## Typography font colors

You are able to assign any color from **hey-ui** to your text.

In order to do this, simply include the name of the color and shade that you want as the prop `color`, e.g. `color="primary-500"`, `color="warning-700"`, `color="highlight-300"`, etc.

You can find all available colors in the Theme documentation of this Storybook.

If this prop is not set, the default is `color=neutral-700`.

## Typography highlight

If you want to highlight a text, simply include the `isHighlighted` prop and the text will be highlighted in default green color.

If this prop is not set, the default is `false`.
