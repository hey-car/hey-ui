import Typography from '../';

The **Typography** component is used to display any types of text present on the **heycar-uikit** design system.

In the design prototypes, when clicking on text, you will find a variant name like `h1`, `subheading2`, `body4`. That's all that you need to get your text component ready.
Each variant contains already the expected font size, font weight, letter spacing, line height, and text transform.

If you need to highlight a text, simply include the prop `highlighted`. In case you want to change the HTML tag the text should be wrapped, you can set a new one with `Component`. Feel free to include customized styles with `className`.

```tsx
<Typography variant="h1">
  Your heading here!
</Typography>

<Typography variant="caption2">
  Your highlighted caption here!
</Typography>

<Typography variant="body2" Component="span">
  Your highlighted body text wrapped in `span` here!
</Typography>
```

## Typography variants

Several typography elements are available in the library. They are listed below.

- Display (`variant="display1"`)
- Heading (`variant="h1|h2|h3|h4|h5|h6"`)
- Sub heading (`variant="subheading1|subheading2"`)
- Body (`variant="body1|body2|body3|body4"`)
- Caption (`variant="caption1|caption2|caption3|caption4|caption5"`)
- Overline (`variant="overline1|overline2"`)

If this prop is not set, the default is `variant="body3"`. You can try the different variants in the playground below.

```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Typography variant="h2">Your big heading is here ü§©</Typography>
    <br />
    <br />
    <Typography variant="subheading2">
      Your sub heading comes right after.
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <br />
    <Typography variant="body5" Component="span">
      Your body text wrapped in `span` here,
      <Typography variant="body5" highlighted Component="span">
        ‚ö†Ô∏è followed by some highlighted text.
      </Typography>
    </Typography>
  </Container>,
);
```

### HTML Tags

The variant `heading` will generate an HTML tag `<h{size}>` corresponding to its size (e.g. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc).

The variant `caption` will generate an HTML tag `<caption>`.

The variants `body` and `display` will generate an HTML tag `<p>`.

The variants `subHeading`, `overline`, and `button` will generate `<span>` HTML tags.

If you need to customize the HTML tag, simply change it with the prop `Component`.

## Mobile versions

The heading and display variants should change properties on mobile views. This is already covered in this component.

## Customized styles and testing

In case you need to add customized styles, add a `className`. For testing purposes, the prop `dataTestId` is also available.
