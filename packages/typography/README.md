The **Typography** component is used to display any types of text present on the **heycar-uikit** design system.

In the design prototypes, when clicking on text, you will find a variant name like `h1`, `subheading2`, `body4`. That's all that you need to get your text component ready.
Each variant contains already the expected font size, font weight, letter spacing, line height, and text transform.

## Installation

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, run the command below using npm:

```bash
npm install @heycar-uikit/typography
```

## Usage

```tsx
import Typography from '@heycar-uikit/Typography';

function App() {
  return <Typography variant="subheading2">Hello World</Typography>;
}
```
