# HeyCar-UIKit - Chip

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. While buttons are expected to appear consistently and with familiar calls to action, chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements.

## Installation

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, run the command below using npm:

```bash
npm install @heycar-uikit/chip
```

## Usage

```tsx
import Chip from '@heycar-uikit/chip';

function App() {
  return <Chip>Mini</Chip>;
}
```
