## Screenshot testing

For the starting work with the screenshot test locally you need to start `storybook`:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

After that run the tests:

```bash
$ npm run test:screenshots
```

### Screenshot files

Screenshot files are stored in [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Installing `git-lfs` on MacOS:

```bash
$ brew install git-lfs
```

**Then you need to install the `git hook`:**

```bash
git lfs install --force
```

Further, you can work with screenshot files in the git as with regular files.

### Screenshot comparison

Screenshot comparison is made using the plugin [jest-image-snapshot](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot).

When you change the screenshot, a folder appears`__diff_output__`, where you can see the changes.

If the changes need to be accepted, then update the screenshots:

```bash
$ npm run test:screenshots -- -u
```
