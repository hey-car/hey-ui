    <p>
      <strong>hey-ui</strong> is a reusable component library that helps{' '}
      <strong>heycar</strong> developers build consistent and memorable user
      interfaces.

      Along with <strong>heycar's</strong> constant international growth, came
      the strong demand for a library that can be used throughout the markets.
      <br />
      With <strong>hey-ui</strong>, we are able to make our several global
      applications look consistent, memorable, and easy to develop.
