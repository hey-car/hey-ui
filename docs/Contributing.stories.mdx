# Contributing üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our library! Before coding, please check the following guidelines and helpful information.

### Guidelines

You are welcome to create new components or update existing ones. But, before you start, please take some time and **read carefully the guidelines explained in this page ü•∏**

If you are a new developer at **heycar**, make sure to check the **[Package structure convention](/docs/guidelines-package-structure-convention--page)** and **[Code style guide](/docs/guidelines-code-style-guide-convention--page)**.
There you will see specific tips on accessing and configuring your environment specifically to Front-end development.

#### Basic requirements

There are some requirements and criteria for the whole **heycar-uikit** library. Make sure you are aware of them before starting development.

- It must support all required browsers.

- It must provide React components ready to use by all of **heycar's** web applications.

- Components should be simple, i.e., they must not contain any business logic, state management, or dependencies that would conflict with or dictate web applications development.

- Components must have sufficient high-quality documentation. This means that each new component must have their corresponding Story, containing examples, available props, and ways of using the component.

- Components must be fully accessible and WCAG-compliant.

- The component library must allow brand customization and theme.

- The component library must provide global styles and typography.

- Components must easily support internationalization

#### Release cycle

For proper release cycle and code support in this repository, you must use the **[git-flow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow)** workflow when creating new branches and releasing new code.
Below is a brief explanation of branch naming:

`main` - Contains only tested code. –°ode gets here from `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches.

`feature/*` - Branches are created based on ticket name, e.g. `feature/HEYUI-999-status-button-component`. Every individual ticket must have its corresponding branch, even for small tasks.

`hotfix/*` - These are branches that contains very urgent fixes for production, e.g. `hotfix/HEYUI-999-fix-button-attribute`.

`bugfix/*` - These branches contain bug fixes and can be merged into `develop`, `release` or `feature` braches, e.g. `bugfix/HEYUI-999-fix-button-attribute`.

### Main scripts

This is the list of scrips that will be helpful to you during development.
//TODO: include more scripts after they're created

- Get started with the storybook

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

- Building packages

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

### Testing

// TODO: include information about unit/... testing

### Trying out components locally

//TODO: explain how to test components locally e.g. yalc, yarn-link etc

### Creating a pull request

When creating your pull request, pay attention to the PR template and the requirements described there.

If your PR is not yet ready to be reviewed, make sure it is a draft or labeled as a `work in progress`.

Don't forget to properly name and label your PR. Examples: `feature: new button [#HEYUI-999]`, `bugfix: fixing header props [#HEYUI-000]`.

In order for it to be merged, at least two approvals are necessary.
