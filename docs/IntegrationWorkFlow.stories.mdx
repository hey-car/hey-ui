# Integration Flow

Welcome to the GDS !  
In this doc we will give you an idea what to do next depending on your current situation and requirement  
There are 3 main paths you can be in, depending on your integration with GDS and the Components implementation status

1.  Happy Path
    - Component in Ready for First Integration / First integration / Recommendation status and your project integrated with hey-uikit
2.  Almost Happy Path
    - Component in Ready/Recommendation status, but project is not integrated with hey-uikit
3.  Adding New Component
    - Component in Proposal status or not found on the storybook
