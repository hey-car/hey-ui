# Integration Flow

Welcome to the GDS !
In this doc we will give you an idea what to do next depending on your current situation and requirement.
There are 3 main paths you can be in, depending on your integration with GDS and the Components implementation status

1.  [Happy Path](/docs/guidelines-integration-workflows-1-happy-path--page)
    - Component in Ready for First Integration / First integration / Recommendation status and your project integrated with hey-uikit
2.  [Almost Happy Path](/docs/guidelines-integration-workflows-2-almost-happy-path--page)
    - Component in Ready/Recommendation status, but project is not integrated with hey-uikit
3.  [Adding New Component](/docs/guidelines-integration-workflows-3-adding-new-component--page)
    - Component in Proposal status or not found on the storybook
